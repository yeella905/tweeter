# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This project is a full-stack web application that I developed to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX on the front end, as well as Node.js and Express on the back end. It serves as a practical exercise in integrating these technologies to build dynamic and interactive web applications.

Features
Front-end development: Responsive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Interactivity: Utilizes jQuery and AJAX for dynamic content updates.
Back-end functionality: Built with Node.js and Express for handling server-side logic.
API Integration: Implements AJAX calls to fetch and display data from external sources.

## Getting Started

2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.
